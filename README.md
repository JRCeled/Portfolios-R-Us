# Portfolios-R-Us

## A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

- The motivation for this project was getting past the feeling of being thrown to the wolves as we are challenged with building a website from scratch after completing two weeks of class. To tell you that this was a huge task for someone that is new to coding is me downplaying the situation. This project definitely required for me to learn how to research properly to solve an issue and how to reference the source as well. I definitely am looking forward to the point where the basics of the course will become second nature as we continue our bootcamp. 
- The project was built as a way to show what we have learned and retained so far in the course. 
- With this project I was able to learn how to step out of my comfort zone and dive in to a slightly deeper section of the pool as I was able to learn the basics of setting up a webpage and styling it using CSS.
